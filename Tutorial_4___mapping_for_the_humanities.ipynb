        "\n",
        "This tutorial outlines how to deploy basic tools in QGIS to tell stories across multiple layers. The goal in this session is to learn approaches to make your maps compelling visual arguments. The final products should make sense at first glance, and convey your desired narrative or analysis. \n",

        "###Topics to cover:  \n",
        "\n",
        "- Quantitative symbology & classification\n",

        "We will use the skills listed above to examine second language speakers and institutions of practice in New York City. New York has an incredible number and variety of second language speakers, yet how and where they are used - in a spoken format - remains less charted, especially on a spatial level. \n",
        "\n",
        "The questions we will be probing include: are there spatial patterns to where speakers of certain languages live within the city? And, drawing on a unique dataset of institutions where a language other than English is expected or formalized, how do these formal and semi-formal spaces map spatially across the city? How do they intersect, if at all, with places of residence? In the next tutorial (5), geoprocessing tools will help formalize these analyses.\n",

        "- Grayscale or a single color range. Most useful when: you are preparing a map for a journal or in-text in a scholarly book and you want to show a range over a wide area, and care less about showing the differences in smaller categories. Many [effective maps](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map) have only needed black and white or a [spectrum of a single color.](http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?trees) \n",
        "\n",
        "- Short spectrum: most frequently used to illustrate intensity and a sharp difference in a single variable, e.g. land plots with some royal ownership share or those without; or the [presence of slavery in the American South.](https://pudding.cool/2017/01/shape-of-slavery/)\n",
        "\n",

        "Does it make sense to show speakers in absolute numbers or as a percentage of all residents inside a tract? Usually the answer with population data is that percentages are more meaningful, especially for comparisons (note that with tracts and other census geography this matters slightly less, as tracts have relatively similar numbers of residents.) For our question, the actual number of speakers made more sense - it's an easier way to convey how many folks there are to talk with in the immediate area.\n",
        "\n",

        "- *Equal interval* means that each group of tracts will be organized according to equivalent numeric ranges of the number of language speakers per tract (e.g. 1-150, 150-300 people). This works best when there are a good number of tracts that fall into each range - not for our language speaker data.\n",

        "[quantiles]\n",
        "- *'Natural' breaks, aka Jenks.* Minimizes variation inside each cluster, so generally falls along already-existing breaks in data. Often looks good, but harder to explain and the breaks may be at points with little meaning (e.g. a cluster with 21-39 speakers and another for 40-301 speakers).\n",
        "[naturalbreaks]\n",
        "[naturalbreaks_inverse]\n",
        "- *'Pretty' breaks* slice along easy-to-remember numbers, e.g. 0-5, 5-25 speakers. \n",
        "-  *Custom*: you can define how many classes you want and where the breaks in your data are. This makes the most sense if you have a theory of something meaningful behind different levels- e.g. if we had a study suggesting that more than 700 speakers in a neighborhood is a threshold for children to retain more of their second language. \n",
        "\n",
        "####Visual hygiene: cleaning out background noise\n",
        "This tutorial referenced the importance of visual heirarchy and minimizing map elements. Sometimes Q maps even a single variable in a 'noisy' way; this is particularly true when our geographic unit is something that isn't particularly meaningful to our story (Who cares or knows about tracts, anyways?!). Some quick tidying can help using the basic display functions, e.g. for the common too-big background lines scenario, as below \n",
